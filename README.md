<h1> 5 Reasons to Visit Kerela </h1>
<ol>
    <h2><li> Kerala Backwaters <br><br> <img src="https://www.affordableluxurytravel.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kerala-Backwaters-2-1536x865.jpg" height="70%" width="90%"> </li></h2> 
   <p> Kerala’s idyllic palm-fringed backwaters look as though they belong on the front of a postcard. The region’s abundantly green landscape is made up of a network of winding lagoons and lakes, interconnected by a labyrinth of canals, rivers, and inlets – it’s a beautiful place to witness.</p>

    <h2><li> Delicious Food <br><br> <img src="https://www.affordableluxurytravel.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/food-in-kerala-1536x1024.jpg" height="70%" width="90%"> </li></h2>

   <p> Nestled on the windward side of the majestic Western Ghats and towering 1,600m above sea level are the region’s fascinating hill stations. These charming emerald green retreats are peppered with tea and coffee plantations and spice gardens, making them a popular attraction among tourists.</p>
   
   <h2><li> Tropical Beaches <br><br> <img src="https://www.affordableluxurytravel.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Tropical-Beaches-in-Kerala-1536x1021.jpg" height="70%" width="90%"> </li></h2>
   <p> It goes without saying that beaches are a major tourist draw, but not everybody considers wrestling for the last sunlounger on a busy stretch as relaxing. 
   
   <li><h2> Wonderful Wildlife <br><br> <img src="https://www.affordableluxurytravel.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Wonderful-Wildlife-Kerala-1536x1026.jpg" height="70%" width="90%"> </h2></li>
   <p> Abundant with rich flora and fauna and over 25 animal sanctuaries and national parks, it’s no surprise that Kerala is abundant with the most beautiful wildlife. The region is a haven for birdwatchers, with sightings of species including the Indian Koel, Ceylon Frogmouth, Loten’s Sunbird and more.</p>
